# Tuples are very similar to lists but they are immutable. i.e once a value is assigned it cannot be changed.
# Tuples are defined in brackets " (  ) "

tup = (1,2,3,4,5)
print(tup)

# tuples can also contains any type of element
tup2 = ("One",2,3.00)
print(tup2)

# tuples cannot be reassigned with any value like in list
# Example - tup2[0] = "1" will give an error
